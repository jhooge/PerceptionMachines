      <description>About Me I&amp;rsquo;m a Bioinformatician with a strong biological background. I&amp;rsquo;m enthusiastic about Machine Learning and Data Science in general. I love working on challenging problems, especially if they are biologically or medically inspired.
About this Blog On this blog I share my experiences on Machine Learning related topis. This includes building and engineering machine learning systems, working with biomedical datasets, discussions of specific algorithms and aproaches in Deep- and traditional Machine Learning, as well as the occasional research paper that caught my eye.</description>
