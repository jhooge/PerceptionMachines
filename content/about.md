# About Me
I'm a Bioinformatician with a strong biological background. I'm enthusiastic about Machine Learning and Data Science in general. I love working on challenging problems, especially if they are biologically or medically inspired. 

# About this Blog
On this blog I share my experiences on Machine Learning related topis. This includes building and engineering machine learning systems, working with biomedical datasets, discussions of specific algorithms and aproaches in Deep- and traditional Machine Learning, as well as the occasional research paper that caught my eye.
